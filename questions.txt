1.  stdint.h is a header file in C that allows programmers to choose integer data types with exact sizes according to the requirement.
2.  The point of using these datatypes is informing the program that the image pixel is using exactly 8 bits or 32 bits.
3.  1,4,4,2
4.  0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal, BM in ASCII, 66 77 in decimal
5.  bfsize gives the bitmap file size whereas bisize gives the structure size, both in bytes.
6.  It means that the bitmap is top-down having origin on upper left corner
7.  biBitCount field in the structure
8.  If its not able to create the output file
9.  It specifies that we are taking only 1 pixel at a time.
10. If bi.bitWidth is 3 i guess the padding will be 3 after doing the modulo math.
11. Gets the next available pixel
12. Is an integer constant, to specify the current position in the file during seeking.
